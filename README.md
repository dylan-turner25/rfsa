# Avaliable Datasets

The following table reports the currently available data sets in the
`rfsa` package. The `Last Updated` column indicates the last time the
data set was updated in the package. The `Data Download Date` indicates
the date that the raw input data for the current year was downloaded
from the FSA website (this is important as these data sets are sometimes
revised or contain projected values for in progress marketing years).
