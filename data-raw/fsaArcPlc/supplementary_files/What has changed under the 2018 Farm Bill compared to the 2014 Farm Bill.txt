What has changed under the 2018 Farm Bill compared to the 2014 Farm Bill?

The effective reference price replaces the reference price for calculating benchmark revenues under ARC and payment rates per unit under PLC.
ARC-county yields are based on data from the Risk Management Agency rather than data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
ARC-county yields are trend adjusted.
Yield designation status under ARC county increases the number of counties from an “All” type designation to an irrigated/non-irrigated designation.
Seed cotton was added as a covered commodity and generic base acres were eliminated beginning with the 2018 crop, the last year of the 2014 Farm Bill. Seed cotton continues to be included as a covered commodity under the 2018 Farm Bill.
Producers may elect for ARC or PLC by covered commodity or ARC-IC for 2019 and 2020 and re-elect each year thereafter through 2023.
One-time opportunity to update PLC program payment yields that take effect beginning with the 2020 crop year.
The effective reference price, ARC-county benchmark yields, and ARC-county benchmark prices calculations are based on a one-year lag (i.e., For program year 2019, crop years 2013-2017 will be used to calculate the effective reference price, ARC-county benchmark yields, and ARC-county benchmark prices, and ARC-individual coverage).
